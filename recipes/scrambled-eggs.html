        <p class="scrambled-content-font">There are plenty of ways to cook eggs in the microwave, but this method for scrambled eggs is perhaps our favorite. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
        <p class="scrambled-content-font">Crack the eggs into a microwave-safe bowl or mug, then mix well with milk and salt. Heat the eggs in the microwave for about 30 seconds, remove and beat well, then return to the microwave for another 30 seconds. Repeat until eggs are fully cooked and scrambled.</p>
